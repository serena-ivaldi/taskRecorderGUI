# taskRecorderGUI

This is an import from the taskRecorderGUI module I developed in the context of the MACSI project. 
It is meant to be used with the taskRecorder module.
It sends commands through the input port of taskRecorder about starting/stopping a recording, and speicfying filenames.
It can be used for multiple trajectories, of course.
Once saved by taskRecorder, the trajectories can be executed ("played") by the taskPlayer module.

The module is based on GTK.
